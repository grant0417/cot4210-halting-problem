# COT 4210 Project - Halting Problem

## Paper

The paper is a report on the halting problem, busy beaver, and the program included.

## Presentation

The presentation is a breif overview of the paper and its findings.

## Program

This is a program that can run any Turing machine and solve the problem iff the Busy
Beaver function is computable for the n states and m symbols of the Turing machine,
unfortunately this is not the case and thus this program is more academic than practical.
